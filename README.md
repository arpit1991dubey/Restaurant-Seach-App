# Restaurant-Seach-App
A restaurant search app to search  for your favorite food with cost filters included.    
1- A demo of usage of REST API in a more porgresseive way in order to fetch request from a server and display the results in a particular fashion.    
2- I've used Yelp api for this app in order to fetch the requests, visit https://www.yelp.com/developers to know more, you need to crate an account for this purpose , an api key will be provided to you after the succesful account creation(i'ts totally free).  
3- Go to the api directory in this repositary to get more detailed insight aboyt the requests posted or fetched through the API.  
4- The UI components are modular and can be used anywhre (just install the necessary dependencies).  
5- I've not focused on the UI part for now, so please spare me for that.  
6- The main focus of this repository is to put a clarity on API requests.  
7- Run 'npm install' to install node modules.  
8- WARNING: Do not use the same App.js file  posted here ,as i have just pasted an instance of a bigger app, so try to make your own navigations (There's no navigations in this one :) ).
